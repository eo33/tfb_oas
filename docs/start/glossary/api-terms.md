# API terms

Below is a glossary explaining common terms related to API usage, HTTP protocols, and the tools that facilitate API interaction.

<table><thead><tr><th width="160">Term</th><th width="614">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>API Key</td><td>A unique identifier used to authenticate requests to an API. It serves as a security measure to ensure that the requester is authorized to access the API. This term is also known as <em>API Token, authorization token,</em> or simply <em>token.</em> </td></tr><tr><td>Authentication</td><td>The process of verifying the identity of a user or system making a request to ensure they are who they claim to be.</td></tr><tr><td>Authorization</td><td>The process of determining whether the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access a resource or perform an action.</td></tr><tr><td>Code Snippets</td><td>Pre-written segments of code that demonstrate how to make requests to an API in different programming languages, making integration easier for developers.</td></tr><tr><td>Content Type</td><td>The type of data being sent or received, such as JSON (application/json) or XML (application/xml). It helps the server understand how to process the data.</td></tr><tr><td>CORS</td><td>A security feature implemented by browsers to restrict web pages from making requests to domains other than the one that served the web page.</td></tr><tr><td>cURL</td><td>A command-line tool used to send HTTP requests. Itâ€™s often used for testing APIs, particularly to retrieve data or perform operations directly from the terminal.</td></tr><tr><td>Endpoint</td><td>A specific URL path where an API can be accessed. It represents a function or resource available via the API.</td></tr><tr><td>HTTP Method</td><td>The action to be performed on a resource via an HTTP request. Common methods include GET (retrieve), POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE (delete).</td></tr><tr><td>Pagination</td><td>A method used to divide large sets of data into pages. This allows users to view manageable portions of data, such as the first 10 or 20 items per page.</td></tr><tr><td>Parameters</td><td>Data sent in the request to provide additional context or information to the API. Parameters can be in the URL, body, or header of the request.</td></tr><tr><td>Path</td><td>The part of the URL that specifies the resource or action to be performed. For example, in api.example.com/users, /users is the path.</td></tr><tr><td>Postman</td><td>A popular tool used to test APIs. It provides a user-friendly interface for sending requests, viewing responses, and organizing API documentation.</td></tr><tr><td>Postman Collection</td><td>A group of related API requests that can be executed together, often used to document and share API workflows and testing procedures.</td></tr><tr><td>Query</td><td>A specific type of parameter that appears in the URL after a question mark (?), typically used for filtering or sorting data. Example: ?category=books.</td></tr><tr><td>Rate Limits</td><td>Restrictions on how many requests can be made to an API in a given period of time, intended to prevent abuse and ensure fair use of resources.</td></tr><tr><td>Request</td><td>A message sent from the client to the server asking for some action, such as retrieving data or performing an operation.</td></tr><tr><td>Response</td><td>The message sent by the server in reply to a request, which typically contains the requested data or a status message about the action performed.</td></tr></tbody></table>
