### 🖥️ **Getting Started with Postman**

**Install Postman**

1. Visit Postman's website.
2. Download and install the Postman app for your operating system.
3. Launch Postman and create an account if required.

#### **Import the Postman Collection**

1. Download The Furniture Bros Postman collection using the **"Run in Postman"** button below:

[![Run In Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/40166625-6cbe30e8-5760-4132-9411-55a3fa300d77?action=collection%2Ffork&source=rip_markdown&collection-url=entityId%3D40166625-6cbe30e8-5760-4132-9411-55a3fa300d77%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D7fcc6d1e-d254-4162-98bf-8e40f5113547)

2. Click the **"Import collection"** link.&#x20;

**Understand the Collection Structure**

- Each collection consists of requests grouped into [different categories](../#endpoint-categories).
- Click on a request to view:
  - **URL:** The API endpoint.
  - **Method:** GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
  - **Headers:** Metadata required by the API.
  - **Body (if applicable):** Data to send with POST or PUT requests.

Learn more about the structure of a **REST API** by visiting the[ making a request ](making-a-request.md)page.

#### **Make Your First Request**

1. Open the collection and select a request. For example, you can use the `POST http://thefurniturebros.com/auth/register`. This request is located under the _Account_ category.&#x20;
2. Fill out the "**Body"** tab with your account `name`, `email` and `password`.
3. Click **"Send"** to execute the request.
4. Review the response in the bottom panel:
   - **Status Code:** Confirms request success (e.g., 200 OK).
   - **Body:** Displays response data from the API.
5. If your request is successful, you will receive an _API Key_. This key acts like a password; it verifies your identify when making a request. Some endpoints require request to be made with an _API Key_, while some don't. Learn more about [authentication](authentication.md).
