# Introduction

### üëã Welcome&#x20;

The Furniture Bros API provides all the tools you need to seamlessly interact with our application and unlock its full functionality.&#x20;

This documentation assumes you have some basics about [Rest API](). If you are new, you can start from the [Get Started]() page.&#x20;

### ü§ñ Postman&#x20;

The fastest way to start using the API is by using Postman. If you are already familiar with Postman, you can start testing out the endpoints using the Postman collection here:

[![Run In Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/40166625-6cbe30e8-5760-4132-9411-55a3fa300d77?action=collection%2Ffork&source=rip_markdown&collection-url=entityId%3D40166625-6cbe30e8-5760-4132-9411-55a3fa300d77%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D7fcc6d1e-d254-4162-98bf-8e40f5113547)

Some endpoints are public, some require an API key, and others need admin privileges. Learn more about [authentication ]()here.

### üèÉ Quick start

You can also interact with the API directly in this site. Here's how to do so:

1. **Obtain Your API Key**: Sign in to your account to access your API credentials. You can use the [Get an API key](https://docs.thefurniturebros.com/api-endpoints/account#auth-login) endpoint to obtain a key.
2. **Explore Endpoints**: Dive into the detailed[ API Reference](https://docs.thefurniturebros.com/api-endpoints) for all available functionality.&#x20;
3. **Start Building**: Use the provided examples to make your first API call.

The API follows REST principles, uses JSON or form-data, and responds with standard HTTP codes. For more information, check out the [Making a request]() page.&#x20;

### üìÅ Endpoint categories

The endpoints are grouped into the following categories for ease of navigation:

- [**Account** ](https://docs.thefurniturebros.com/api-endpoints/account)- Manage user accounts, view profiles, and update account information.
- [**Product** ](https://docs.thefurniturebros.com/api-endpoints/product)- View, search, and manage product information.
- [**Cart** ](https://docs.thefurniturebros.com/api-endpoints/cart)- Add, update, and remove items from the shopping cart.&#x20;
- [**Address** ](https://docs.thefurniturebros.com/api-endpoints/address)- Add, update, and manage shipping addresses.
- [**Orders**](https://docs.thefurniturebros.com/api-endpoints/orders)<mark style="color:red;">\*</mark> - Handle order creation, updates, and management.&#x20;
- [**Statistics**](https://docs.thefurniturebros.com/api-endpoints/statistics)<mark style="color:red;">\*</mark> - Access insights about users, products, and orders.&#x20;

&#x20;<mark style="color:red;">\*Note: Admin access required.</mark>&#x20;

Each of these categories has it's own use cases for your needs. Learn more about them by visiting the [Functionalities ]()page.&#x20;

The API docs may include technical terms specific to their functionality (e.g. pagination, API key, content-type). The [Glossary ]()page lists these terms and serves as your reference when needed.

### üåæ Integration Examples

If you're familiar with REST API concepts and have your app set up, go to the [Examples ]()page for examples of integrating code snippets. Each endpoint in the docs offers code samples in various languages, using either SDKs or built-in libraries‚Äîchoose what works best for you. You can also use the Postman collection and check the code snippets tab for auto-generated code in different languages.
