This release introduces essential user authentication and session management features for the e-commerce application. It enables users to sign up, securely log in, and maintain a persistent session across pages, while also allowing guest users to browse without creating an account. Key features include:

- **User Sign-Up & Login**: New and registered users can now securely create and access their accounts.
- **Authentication Flow**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for secure authentication, ensuring users remain logged in during their session.
- **Protected Routes**: Certain features like adding items to the cart and placing orders are restricted to authenticated users.
- **Guest User Access**: Non-registered users can browse the app without the need for an account.
