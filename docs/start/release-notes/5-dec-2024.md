This release focuses on enhancing the documentation for the **Furniture Bros API** to provide users and developers with comprehensive, accessible, and up-to-date resources. The main components include:

1. **GitBook Setup:** A GitBook instance has been set up to host and structure the documentation, including pages on authentication, pagination, errors, release notes, and API endpoints.
2. **OpenAPI Specification (OAS) Repository:** A dedicated repository for the OAS 3.0 file has been created, enabling version control and easier management of API specifications, which ensures that developers can modify and track changes over time.
3. **Postman Collection Integration:** The Postman collection has been added to GitBook, allowing users to easily download and test the API endpoints. This makes it easier for developers to interact with the API, test different requests, and get familiar with the system.
4. **Secondary Content Creation:** The documentation has been enriched with secondary content to help users get started, including explanations of REST APIs, request examples, and a glossary. This content also covers the latest updates to the API, ensuring users stay informed.

This enhancement ensures that the documentation is thorough, up-to-date, and user-friendly, offering all the necessary tools to interact with and understand the **Furniture Bros API**.
